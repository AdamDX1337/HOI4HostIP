# HOI4HostIP
Python script that displays a Hosts IP address on connection.

for some reason the second IP always displayed will be your local ip, IGNORE it!

# I should probably put this disclaimer here to say that it is wildly illegal to use this for any malicious purposes, it is legal however to get peoples IPs, the reason I developed this is to practice my python, but I plan to fix the player version, it should be used so people who are hacking in ghost mode can be detected and their ip banned from the game.

# DO NOT use this program for anything illegal, and if you're a host and now know this exists, I urge you to host privately or use a VPN.


### 1. Install python.
### 2. Open an administrator command prompt.
### 3. Type 'pip install pydivert' into cmd. (first time use only) #Skip this if you already have it
### 4. Type 'python'. Python should now be running.
### 5. Run the script. Type exec(open("C:/path_to_script_here.py").read()) in the python terminal or another way.
